## Overview of NLP

A [document](Overview_of_NLP.pdf) summarizing NLP and my views on it.

## Simple Text Processing

This program takes a data sheet with employee information and asks the user to normalize/correct the information as needed. The information is then placed into a dictionary that is finally pickled.

You can see the [code here](https://github.com/KaeCan/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Homework1/Homework1_kxc180021.py).

## Exploring NLTK

This is a Python notebook documenting my first experience and usage of NLTK. I explain a few basic methods and use cases, and I provide simple explanations and comparisons on common methods.

You can see the [notebook here](https://github.com/KaeCan/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Exploring_NLTK.ipynb).

## Word Guessing Game

This is a program that was used to explore Python and NLTK features in analyzing text files. First, it extracts text from a large file, in this case an entire chapter from an anatomy textbook. Then, lexical analysis and preprocessing will be performed to prepare words for a word guessing game.

The guessing game is essentially a variation of Hangman, where users guess letters and receive a score dependent on how well they did.

You can see the [code here](https://github.com/KaeCan/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Word_Guesser/word_guess_game.py) and the [anatomy text here](https://github.com/KaeCan/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Word_Guesser/anat19.txt). I followed this set of [criteria](https://github.com/KaeCan/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Word_Guesser/Ch5%20Word%20Guess%20Game.pdf) for grading.

## Exploring WordNet

This is a Python notebook documenting my first experience and usage of NLTK's interface with WordNet. I demonstrate a few use cases and how to extract information. You can see the [notebook here](https://github.com/KaeCan/NLP_Portfolio/blob/main/Exploring_WordNet.ipynb).
